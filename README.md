## Hebbian Neuron 
### Hebbian Neuron : 

The hebbian neuron: 
The following project is an attempt to create a artificial neural network that can be trained using Hebbian principles. 

My goal for this project is threefold: 
 1. To create a network that can be infinitely grown to learn new patterns of data without re-training the entire network. 
 2. To create a network that has the ability to track the age of each learned pattern. 
 3. To be biologically plausible by not requiring backpropagation, or gradient descent.
